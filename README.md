# News-Highlight


## Description
This web-app allows the user to choose news from a particular source and view the articles within that source.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Live site can be accessed from the following link https://newsshighlights.herokuapp.com


### Known Bugs
Some sources have no news thus the page will be blank.
The panels are sometimes irregular due to different image/description sizes.

### Behaviour Driven Development
* The program should return a source's articles when chosen.<br> 
Given: Sources are available<br>
When: A source is chosen<br>
Then: Articles from that source are shown<br>




### Technologies Used

* Git and Github were used as my local and online repositories respectively.
* Flask was used as the micro-framework
* Heroku was used in deploying the live site
